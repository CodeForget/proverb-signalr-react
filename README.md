Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  This is a collection of variations upon a the proverb theme.  Different versions of "Proverb" built using different technologies and techniques for kicks and giggles.  It's a playground for me.  

This repository is using the following technologies:

- TypeScript
- AngularJS 1.3

This is the AngularJS front end of Proverb.
